* Notes on Python Programming



** List Comprehensions

Example

>>> [x+1 for x in range(1, 10)]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]





** Assignment Operator (3.8)

There is new syntax := that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. It is affectionately known as “the walrus operator” due to its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.

In this example, the assignment expression helps avoid calling len() twice:

if (n := len(a)) > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 10)")
